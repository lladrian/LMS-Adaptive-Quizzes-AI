Okay, here's a simple Python quiz:\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat will be the output of the following Python code?\n\n```python\nx = 5\ny = \"5\"\n\nif x == y:\n  print(\"Equal\")\nelse:\n  print(\"Not Equal\")\n```\n\n**Possible Answers:**\n\na) Equal\nb) Not Equal\nc) Error\nd) None of the above\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe correct answer is **b) Not Equal**.\n\nAlthough the values *look* the same, `x` is an integer (number) and `y` is a string (text). Python is a strongly typed language and distinguishes between data types. The `==` operator checks for equality of value **and** data type.  Because the types are different, the condition `x == y` is false, and the `else` block is executed.\n
